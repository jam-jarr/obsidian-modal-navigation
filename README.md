# Obsidian Menu Navigation

This is a very simple plugin that allows you to navigate modal options using vim/emacs style bindings.

## Usage

While a modal is open (e.g. quick switcher or command pallete) press <Ctrl-j> or <Ctrl-n> to cycle forward and <Ctrl-k> or <Ctrl-p> to cycle backward.

That's it!
